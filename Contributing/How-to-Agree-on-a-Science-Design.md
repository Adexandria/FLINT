## Agree on a Science Design  

moja global tools have to be in line with the latest science and international standards. Therefore all code is informed by a science design stored in the Science folder of each repository. Code revisions might require a revision of the science design. When in doubt, ask the @TSC or just follow the procedures below.

1. Invite Your Team
    * When you start a new project and are inviting your team to join, make sure that you invite (at least 1) accomplished scientists to review or develop a Science Design
    * If your project does not need changes to the existing Science Design, write a short justification mentioning the revision of your  and add nclude a document 
    * 

At the end, this happens    
    * The new Science Design is copied into a Google Doc with a [Science Release Version](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Use-moja-global-Versioning.md) number. 
1. Review and Approval by Science Panel
    * A Science Panel consists of at least 1 expert recognized as an authority in the field
    * The Science Panel reviews the Science Release document and   Scientist(s) is (are) given edit rights to the Release document. The collaborators can comment on the remarks from the Scientist(s) but are no longer allowed to make other comments. 
The maintainers respond to the comments from the scientist(s) and submit the final version to the Chair of the Technical Steering Committee who approves the document by ??? (HOW)
The document is now closed for changes and made public. The ownership is transferred to moja global and the link is published in the GitHub wiki of the project, send to all collaborators and the link included in the next newsletter.
