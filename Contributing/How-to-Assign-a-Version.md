## moja global Versioning

Most moja global tools are platforms combined with modules. This results in many dependencies which in turn require tight version control without losing flexibility. 

moja global projects use a slightly adapted [semantic versioning]() because projects need to be based on a science design.

### Standard Format  

The version number consists of 4 indicators and a label: SCIENCE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-, increment the:

* SCIENCE version when you make changes to the science design,  
* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,    
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes, and   
* Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the SCIENCE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
