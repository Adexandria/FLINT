## Start a new Project

1. Avoid Duplication:
    * Before starting a new project, review whether an existing project already is implementing your idea:
        * All projects are listed in the "Project" tab of the moja global root directory 
        * Please also review the existing repositories as not all may be listed under the "Project" tab
        * Finally, have a look at the [Strategic Plan](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Governance/Strategic-Plan.md) for this year, if you idea is listed a project will be in preparation  
    * If your project idea already exists, please join forces with those already active. Else (i.e. your project does not exist) proceed with the next step.    

1. [Create a Repository](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-To-Create-a-Repository.md) even if you are not part of the moja global organisation (yet)
1. Create a project board to track and update your work 
    * If you are a part of the moja organisation use the project list under .github. 
    * If you are not (yet) part of the moja global organisation, use the project list in your repository. You can notify the wider moja global community by opening an issue under .github informing that you have started a new project.
1. Invite your team
    * [Invite your team](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team) to join the project even [if they are not part of the moja global organisation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)
    * Assign roles: scientists, coders, editors, maintainers (for code and science), etc. Try to have at least 2 persons for each role to avoid overloading your team.
