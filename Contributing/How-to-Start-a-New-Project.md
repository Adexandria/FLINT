## Start a new Project

1. Avoid Duplication:
    * Before starting a new project, review whether an existing project already is implementing your idea:
        * All projects are listed in the "Project" tab of the moja global root directory 
        * Please also review the existing repositories as not all may be listed under the "Project" tab
        * Finally, have a look at the [Strategic Plan](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Governance/Strategic-Plan.md) for this year, if you idea is listed a project will be in preparation  
    * If your project idea already exists, please join forces with those already active. Else (i.e. your project does not exist) proceed with the next step.    

1. [Create a Repository](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-To-Create-a-Repository.md) even if you are not part of the moja global organisation (yet)
1. Add your project to the list under .github
